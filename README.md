* npm install
* bower install
* karma start
* scss --watch style.scss:style.css
* I haven't implemented GULP / GRUNT simply because this is a very simple example. I will share some Angular projects I did recently which show way more.
* I haven't used browserify nor Webpack since we have just one component and barely few files.
* I usually use npm only but I wanted to use both, npm and bower just for demonstration
* I haven't used ngAnnotate / ngTemplates etc. simply because it isn't part of this exercise. We are not minifying anything nor bundling so it was unnecessary.
