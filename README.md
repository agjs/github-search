# github-search

Dear Aleksandar,

Thanks a lot for the nice call today!

As a next step in the selection process we would kindly ask you to show us a little more of your coding skills by solving the following exercise:

Build a simple client-side app that lists github repositories for a given user

Use the github api documented here: https://developer.github.com/v3/ (sample request: https://api.github.com/users/kibo007/repos )

The end-user will enter a Github user's name and see a list of repositories for that user including a link to the repos. App needs to correctly handle the following events:

The Github user does not exist
Github user has no repos
Github API does not respond
We expect clear separation of responsibility (services, directives, controllers) and at least some unit-tests.

Use any JavaScript libraries necessary but no more than necessary.

angular
sass/less
html5
bootstrap
some third party plugins
Please upload the solution to your github account once you have completed it and send me the link until tomorrow. The exercise shouldnÂ´t take more than a few hours.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Bojan (Email: bojan.dragojevic@goeuro.com, Skype: bojan.goeuro) who is eager to help you :)

Thanks in advance & enjoy the puzzle!
