# github-search

* npm install
* bower install
* karma start
* scss --watch style.scss:style.css
* I haven't implemented GULP / GRUNT simply because this is a very simple example. I will share some Angular projects I did recently which show way more.
* I haven't used browserify nor Webpack since we have just one component and barely few files.
* I usually use npm only but I wanted to use both, npm and bower just for demonstration
* I haven't used ngAnnotate / ngTemplates etc. simply because it isn't part of this exercise. We are not minifying anything nor bundling so it was unnecessary.
Dear Aleksandar,

Thanks a lot for the nice call today!

As a next step in the selection process we would kindly ask you to show us a little more of your coding skills by solving the following exercise:

Build a simple client-side app that lists github repositories for a given user

Use the github api documented here: https://developer.github.com/v3/ (sample request: https://api.github.com/users/kibo007/repos )

The end-user will enter a Github user's name and see a list of repositories for that user including a link to the repos. App needs to correctly handle the following events:

- The Github user does not exist
- Github user has no repos
- Github API does not respond
- We expect clear separation of responsibility (services, directives, controllers) and at least some unit-tests.

Use any JavaScript libraries necessary but no more than necessary.

- angular
- sass/less
- html5
- bootstrap
- some third party plugins

Please upload the solution to your github account once you have completed it and send me the link until tomorrow. The exercise shouldnÂ´t take more than a few hours.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Bojan (Email: bojan.dragojevic@goeuro.com, Skype: bojan.goeuro) who is eager to help you :)

Thanks in advance & enjoy the puzzle!
